# ATM API Backend

## Prerequisites

-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.0 or higher)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd node-js-api
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:
    ```
    PORT=3000
    ```

## Usage

### Development

To run the server in development mode with auto-reloading:

```bash
bun run dev
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production

To build and run the server in production mode:

1.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

2.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    bun run start
    ```

## Running with Docker

You can also run the application using Docker and Docker Compose.

1.  **Build and run with Docker Compose (recommended):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This command builds the image and starts the container in the background. The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. The `db.json` file is mounted as a volume to persist data across container restarts.

2.  **Manual build and run with Docker:**
    -   **Build the image:**
        ```bash
        docker build -t node-js-api .
        ```
    -   **Run the container:**
        ```bash
        docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ./db.json:/app/db.json --env-file ./.env node-js-api
        ```

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`.

### Testing with Bruno

This project includes a [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) collection located in the `http-request-collection/` directory. Bruno is an open-source API client, similar to Postman, that allows you to test the API endpoints easily.

To use it:
1.  Download and install Bruno from their official website.
2.  Open Bruno and click on "Open Collection".
3.  Navigate to the `http-request-collection/` folder in this project and select it.
4.  The collection with all the API requests will be loaded, ready for you to use.

### Users & Accounts
- `POST /api/users`: Create a new user.
  - **Body**: `{ "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com", "password": "yourpassword" }`
- `POST /api/accounts`: Create a new bank account.
  - **Body**: `{ "userId": "user-id", "currency": "USD", "initialBalance": 1000 }`
- `GET /api/accounts/user/:userId`: Get all accounts for a user.
- `GET /api/accounts/:accountId`: Get details for a specific account.

### Cards
- `POST /api/cards`: Create a new card for an account.
  - **Body**: `{ "accountId": "account-id", "type": "debit", "pin": "1234" }`
- `GET /api/cards/:cardId`: Get details for a specific card.
- `POST /api/cards/activate`: Activate a card.
  - **Body**: `{ "cardId": "card-id", "pin": "1234" }`
- `PATCH /api/cards/:cardId/pin`: Change a card's PIN.
  - **Body**: `{ "oldPin": "1234", "newPin": "5678" }`

### Operations
- `GET /accounts/:accountId/movements`: Get all movements for an account. **(Note: This route is currently disabled in `src/routes.ts`)**
- `POST /api/deposits`: Make a deposit to an account.
  - **Body**: `{ "cardId": "card-id", "amount": 200 }`
- `POST /api/withdrawals`: Make a withdrawal from an account.
  - **Body**: `{ "cardId": "card-id", "amount": 100 }`
- `POST /api/transfers`: Transfer funds between accounts.
  - **Body**: `{ "fromAccountId": "account-id-1", "toIban": "ES...", "amount": 50 }`

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular, layered architecture:

-   `src/`: Main source code directory.
    -   `adapters/`: Connectors to external systems (e.g., database).
    -   `config/`: Application configuration.
    -   `middleware/`: Express middlewares.
    -   `modules/`: Feature-based modules (e.g., `user`, `account`, `card`). Each module contains its own router, controller, services, schemas, and types.
    -   `routes.ts`: Main API router that aggregates all module routers.
    -   `app.ts`: Express application setup.
    -   `index.ts`: Application entry point.

## Tests Statement

A client in the financial sector has asked us to develop the API that will be used by their own ATMs as well as those of other banks. Fortunately, we donâ€™t need to build any UI, so this is a pure back-end task.

## ðŸ“‹ Specifications

### 1. View Account Activity

* **Endpoint:** `GET /accounts/{accountId}/transactions`
* **Functionality:**

  * Customers can view transactions on any of their accounts by specifying the `accountId`.
  * Transactions include:

    * Cash **deposits** and **withdrawals**
    * **Fees** charged
    * **Incoming** and **outgoing** **transfers**
  * Each transaction record must include a `type` field indicating its category (e.g., `withdrawal`, `deposit`, `transfer`, `fee`).

### 2. Withdraw Cash

* **Endpoint:** `POST /accounts/{accountId}/withdraw`
* **Functionality:**

  * Only withdraw from the account linked to the inserted card.
  * **Debit cards:** Restricted by available balance.
  * **Credit cards:** Can withdraw up to the credit limit (but not beyond).
  * **All cards:** Cannot exceed the per-card withdrawal limit.
  * **Interbank ATMs:** Apply external-bank fees when applicable.

### 3. Deposit Cash

* **Endpoint:** `POST /accounts/{accountId}/deposit`
* **Functionality:**

  * Only deposit into the account linked to the inserted card.
  * **Allowed only at our bankâ€™s ATMs.** Deposits at other banksâ€™ ATMs must be rejected.

### 4. Make Transfers

* **Endpoint:** `POST /transfers`
* **Functionality:**

  * Transfer funds to accounts at:

    * Our bank
    * Other banks
  * **Validations:**

    1. Ensure the destination IBAN is well-formed.
    2. Apply interbank transfer fees where applicable.

### 5. Activate Card

* **Endpoint:** `POST /cards/{cardId}/activate`
* **Functionality:**

  * First-time card usage requires activation before any other operations.

### 6. Change PIN

* **Endpoint:** `PUT /cards/{cardId}/pin`
* **Functionality:**

  * Customers can change their PIN at any time.
  * **Mandatory** PIN change immediately after initial activation.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Considerations

* **Version Control**

  * Use **Git** with **Git Flow** methodology.
  * Make **frequent, meaningful commits**; the bankâ€™s team will review the code regularly.

* **Testing**

  * Implement both **unit tests** and **integration tests**.

* **Security**

  * Treat the **PIN** as sensitive data; **never store it in plain text**.

* **CI/CD**

  * Preferably set up **GitLab CI**, **GitHub Actions**, or **Jenkins** to:

    * Run tests
    * Build the application
    * Deploy automatically
